# TASK-101 Cards and Transactions Overview
------------------------------- MY NOTES -------------------------------
## THE STACK  - requirements
- yarn + React + Vite + Typescript
- Eslint + prettier, for clean code
- styled components, for flexibility, straight forward implementation and consistent design

- tsconfigPaths for absolute path (changes to vite.config and tsconfig.app.json)
- semantic html
- document/comment


## TO-DOs/MVP roadmap
- [x] install all necessary tools
- [x] create small design system (colors, and corner roundness)
- [ ] error, idle, loading states?
- [ ] add example tests?

test cases
- only one card
- more than two cards
- no cards?
- no transactions?
- - fetch cards or fetch transactions error

## My thoughts
Assuming that the card list is not very big but possibly > 2

I like the clean design and I think it works with the right color scheme, but I would maybe suggest a few changes to the card selection and the filter:
I would talk with the designers about making it more clear which card is currently selected, by changing not only the color/opacity but also the size,
so I would keep the selected card the "normal" size and amke the other(s) a bit smaller, for what i find would be a more intuitive setup.


And I would also suggest, for a later version to think about making the filter a range rather than "from" amount,
or maybe even allow the user to choose a preset range (eg. +- 10, 20, 100 etc.)
For now I have only added a label that specifies that the amount is from and not the exact amount

I added more cards and more transactions for testing purposes, some cards don't have corresponding trnasactions
so it shows and error
## Further into the future
For post mvp version I would
- add translation/copy files, with i18n or similar
- add testing
- add error boundary
- add 404 page
- add light/dark mode
- dockerize the app
- consider separating the cards and transaction logics into two separate hooks 

## How to run 
to run `yarn ` and then `yarn dev`




------------------------------- THE INSTRUCTIONS -------------------------------

Hellow there!😁 first of all, thanks for taking the time and your interest in joining Code Factory!
As part of joining our engineering, we share this simple challenge with you.

Happy coding!

## Task

The purpose of this task is to build a card and transactions overview page. The user should be able to select one of the cards, see it's transactions and be able to filter the transactions based on the amount.

You will find an image in the folder /docs, it gives a visual overview of how the page is intended to look like.

## Notes

Please install dependencies using `yarn`.

Typescript is a must.

We provided a fake ApiClient for you that fetches the data. If you want to improve this client and adjust it to your needs feel free to do so.

You can always extend with more data if you feel like it.

If you feel like the design does not make sense, adjust it and note how you would communicate your suggestions with a designer.

## AC

- User can select one of the cards ✅
- The transactions of the selected card will be displayed.✅
- The transactions have a same background color than the card.
- There should be a filter field between the cards and the transactions. ✅
- The user can filter transactions by inputting amount to the filter fields. Transactions with the amount in the fields or greater should be left visible. ✅ BUT need fix filtering float  
- If the user changes a selected card and there is content in the filter fields, the content should be resetted.

## Deliverables

- Share with us a zip file wtih your source code excluding the node_modules folder
